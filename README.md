# slot_booking_covid_vaccine

Their are some important point that you should keep in mind:-
1. This is just a concept project and i dont endrose or condone in ny shape or form , automating any kind of monitoring or booking tasks... so kindly use it at your own risk
2. This python program cannot book slots automatically but you can make changes at your own risk to automate it completely but you will still have to enter OTP and captcha
3. Do NOT use unless all the beneficiaries selected are supposed to get the same vaccine and dose.
4. There is no option to register new mobile or add beneficiaries. This can be used only after beneficiary has been added through the official app/site.
5. This goes without saying but, once you get your vaccine, please do help out any underprivileged people around you who may not have a laptop or the know-how. For instance any      sort of domestic help, or the staff in your local grocery store, or literally the thousands of people who don't have the knowledge or luxury we do.
6. API Details (read the first paragraph at least): https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin/cowin-public-v2
7. And finally, I know code quality isn't great. Suggestions are welcome.

2. Download this code as zip, and extract it to some folder like C:\temp\slot_booking_covid_vaccine  or any folder .
3. open command prompt in that specific folder
4. and run this command :-      pip install -r required_libs.txt
5. this command will help you to install all the library that are need for this program
6. and finally run this program by this command :-       python slot_booking_covid_vaccine.py

"this program may give error in linux or mac operating system because of some specific libraries so install library accordingly that are mentioned inside the program "
